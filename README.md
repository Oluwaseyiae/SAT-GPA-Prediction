# Predicting First-Year GPA: Insights from SAT Scores and High School Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes SAT and GPA data for 1,000 students to predict first-year college GPA based on SAT scores and high school GPA. The aim is to explore how well SAT scores and high school academic performance correlate with first-year success.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and includes the following columns:
- **sex**: Gender of the student
- **sat_v**: Verbal SAT percentile
- **sat_m**: Math SAT percentile
- **sat_sum**: Total SAT score (verbal + math)
- **hs_gpa**: High school grade point average
- **fy_gpa**: First-year college grade point average

## Goals
- Explore the relationship between SAT scores, high school GPA, and first-year GPA.
- Perform Linear Regression to predict first-year GPA.
- Analyze the impact of gender on academic performance.
